Sponsors
Powerful relationships with corporate partners, community leaders, and generous individuals are the backbone of team xbot's growing success. Students strengthen these relationships by working with our sponsors to learn cutting edge technologies, reaching out to professionals around the nation. We thank all these people for being an inspiration and allowing us to continue forging new, long-lasting bonds with mentors that extend beyond the classroom, workshops, or competitions.
